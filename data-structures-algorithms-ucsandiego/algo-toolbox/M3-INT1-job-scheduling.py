Job Scheduling Problem
Given an array of jobs, where each job is associated with its profit and deadline, find an ordering of all jobs that maximizes the profit. A job
generates a profit only if it is completed before
the deadline.

Input: An array of jobs, where each job Job is associated with its profit (denoted as profit(Job)) and deadline (denoted as deadline(Job)). 
Each job takes a single unit of time and no two jobs can be performed at the same time.
Given an ordering of all jobs, we say that the i-th job Job in this ordering is well-scheduled if i â‰¤ deadline(Job), i.e., if it is finished before the deadline.
The profit of this ordering is defined as the total profit of all well-scheduled jobs. 
We assume that the first job starts at time 0. 
Output: Ordering of all jobs that maximizes the profit among all possible orderings.
